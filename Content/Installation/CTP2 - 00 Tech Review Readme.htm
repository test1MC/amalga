        <p class="note">This page outlines known issues with the tech review version of the Installation document. Please be sure to read this page prior to reviewing the document.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Brussels installation guide is not included here. It will be sent out for a seperate review with the Brussels team</li>
            <li>This document has not been through the editorial process. Some grammatical errors may be present</li>
            <li>This document has not been checked for standardized formatting. This will be done during the editorial review process by the writer</li>
            <li>This document was written with minimal information regarding clustered environments. If clustered environments are in your area of responsibility, please pay careful attention to the relevant command lines</li>
            <li>Entity management and application linking is under development. It is anticipated that more detail will be provided for the final release. Please provide as much input on this section as possible.</li>
            <li>Setup.exe command lines should receive extra-attention as they are a weak spot in CTP1 documentation</li>
            <li>Notes in RED&#160;are for review and internal use only. They will not be seen by the customer.</li>
            <li>Note the questions in the Application Host section around certain commands and where they should be run.</li>
            <li>In order to get this document into review as quickly as possible, the application deployment section has been reused from the CTP1 documents. This section will be streamlined for CTP2. Please comment on the CTP1 documentation provided here to ensure the updated version is as accurate as possible.</li>
            <li>HealthVault Connector has not been walked-through with test at this time. Steps need to be verified</li>
