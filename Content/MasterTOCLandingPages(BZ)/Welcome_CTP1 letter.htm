        <h1 style="font-style: normal;">Welcome to <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Long" />! </h1>
        <p>With the support of a strong partner community, we have learned a lot and made a ton of progress since our last technical preview in November. Our development partners took CTP1 and built fantastic apps that wowed the crowd at <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2012-03-13T14:14:53.5852028-07:00" MadCap:creator="v-labenn" MadCap:initials="LLB" MadCap:comment="&quot;at the 2012 ...conference&quot;" MadCap:editor="v-labenn" MadCap:editDate="2012-03-13T14:15:25.8887447-07:00">HIMSS</MadCap:annotation> in February. Together we are well on our way to making the Amalga vision a reality—a vision of an open platform to aggregate, manage and enable new uses of data across and between health enterprises, with tools for centrally managing and auditing data access. The work you’ve done is already proving that developers can use the platform to create compelling applications designed to support better decision-making in patient care.</p>
        <p>Since CTP1, we have also announced that Microsoft and GE Healthcare are planning to form a new venture called Caradigm.  Combining Microsoft’s unique strengths in building enterprise software with GE Healthcare’s deep knowledge of clinical workflow and solutions, we’re focused on building <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2012-03-08T19:05:31.1580045-08:00" MadCap:creator="v-ciwyco" MadCap:initials="CJW" MadCap:comment="Repeated in previous paragraph. I searched for an alternative but no satisfying one found." MadCap:editor="v-ciwyco" MadCap:editDate="2012-03-09T15:01:54.1132320-08:00">solutions</MadCap:annotation> that support new ways of understanding and acting on the needs of patient populations.</p>
        <p>I’m thrilled to be a part of this new adventure. Peter Neupert, Sean Nolan and the entire team have done an incredible job in landing the vision for Amalga 3.0 and delivering the preview releases. I am incredibly honored to share with you our last Amalga preview under the Microsoft banner, and look forward to working together as I take on my role as Caradigm’s CTO and Senior Vice President, Engineering.</p>
        <p>We eagerly anticipate continued collaboration as we bring Amalga 3.0 and the next wave of solutions to the changing healthcare market.</p>
