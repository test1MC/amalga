        <h1>Application publishing and packaging tools</h1>
        <p class="abstract">
            <MadCap:keyword term="Visual Studio;application deployment;application packaging" />This topic describes the application publishing and packaging tools available for hosted applications.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" /> provides a publishing feature that you can use to publish hosted applications for debugging purposes from within the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingMS.Microsoft Visual Studio 2010" /> integrated development environment (IDE). </p>
        <p>The publishing feature allows you to rapidly test a hosted application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Automatically removes existing instances of the hosted application.</li>
            <li>Automatically resolves the application manifest and service manifests by  using testing-specific elements and attributes in the application manifest and service manifests of a hosted application.</li>
            <li>Deploys the hosted application on a specified target topology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more information about using the application publishing tools to debug a hosted application in <MadCap:variable name="BrandingMS.Visual Studio 2010 second use" />, see <MadCap:xref href="SDK_CON_Deploy_Test_Dev.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Debugging a hosted application on page 1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <p>Once you have finished testing, you can use the packaging feature (also provided by <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" />) to package your hosted application into an appropriately structured <MadCap:variable name="Filenames.Doors cabinet (.cab)" /> file for deployment using the deployment tools provided with the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV3 second use" />&#160;platform.</p>
