        <p class="abstract">
            <MadCap:keyword term="hosted applications" />This topic presents the  advantages of developing <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" /> hosted applications with <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" />.</p>
        <p>When building an application or service that makes use of the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" /> platform, you have the option to make it a hosted application. If you do not make it a hosted application, then you can still use the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" /> platform and take advantage of many of its features, such as entities and security. </p>
        <p>However, hosted applications can take advantage of several features provided by the <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga fabric first use" /> and <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" />, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Management<a href="Renamed Me.htm">MyNewTopic</a></p>
                <p>The configuration and infrastructure required for a hosted application can be managed through the <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Microsoft Amalga Management Console" />.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Monitoring</p>
                <p>Logging, auditing, and performance monitoring are all easily included in a hosted application, with full support in both <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV3 second use" /> and Doors tools.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Security</p>
                <p>Hosted applications can take advantage of the authentication and authorization features available to <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV3 second use" />, which are easily tailored for the business requirements of a hosted application.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Service-oriented architecture</p>
                <p><MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV3 second use" /> provides a flexible service-oriented architecture , with clustering support, into which a hosted application is easily integrated.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>By using hosted  applications, you can focus on the business logic that is specific to your application, and let <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" /> handle functions that are common to <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV3 second use" /> applications. The <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" /> provides a set of development resources to make developing hosted applications easier and faster.</p>
