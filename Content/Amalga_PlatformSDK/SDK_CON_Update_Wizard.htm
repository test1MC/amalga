            <MadCap:keyword term="Update Wizard;Virtual Schema Designer;data manifests;virtual schema" />This topic describes the Update Wizard, included with <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" /> and used with <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.virtual schema designer" /> to update a data manifest (.edmx) file after changes have been made to the underlying data source.</p>
        <p>The Update Wizard in <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" /> is used to add, refresh, or delete entity definitions contained in the storage model of a data manifest (.edmx) file from an underlying data source, such as the <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.entity registry" />. </p>
        <p>The Update Wizard starts after you right-click the data manifest file in Solution Explorer and select <span class="UIElementAction">Update Model from Database</span>. <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2011-10-28T15:25:18.4928159-07:00" MadCap:creator="v-labenn" MadCap:initials="LLB" MadCap:comment="for post-CTP, how about a screen shot?\r\n[DWK] Absolutely.

                        <p class="note">The Update Wizard applies English language rules for singulars and plurals by creating a PluralizationService and passing it to an EntityModelSchemaGenerator.</p>

                        <p class="note">If a table in an underlying data source contains only foreign keys (sometimes called a pure join table), the wizard will not generate a corresponding entity type, nor will it generate properties on related entity types that correspond to the foreign keys. Instead, a many-to-many association will be generated between the two entity types linked by the pure join table.</p>

MadCap:editor="v-dennk" MadCap:editDate="2011-11-16T15:01:30.0740338-08:00">If</MadCap:annotation> an object has been deleted from the underlying data source, the wizard removes the object from the data manifest. Mapping specifications are updated so that application views in the application virtual schema are not mapped to objects that no longer exist.</li>
            <li>If an object has been added to the underlying data source (or was not included in the data manifest), you can choose to add the object to the data manifest. The storage model in the data manifest is then updated with the newly-added object. In the case of a table or view, a corresponding entity type is created and mapped to the object.</li>
            <li>If an object has been updated, the wizard updates the object definition in the storage model of the data manifest. If any new columns have been added to a table or view, the corresponding entity types are updated with matching properties. If the corresponding entity types are part of an inheritance hierarchy, only the affected entity closest to the root of the hierarchy is updated with matching properties. This prevents child entities in the hierarchy from defining the same properties as their ancestors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">If you delete an object from the conceptual model, but then decide you want to use the Update Wizard to add the object back to the conceptual model, you must first delete the object from the storage model.</p>
