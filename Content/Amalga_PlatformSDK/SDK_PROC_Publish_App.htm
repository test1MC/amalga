        <h1>Publish a hosted application for debugging</h1>
        <p class="PersonaAll">&#160;</p>
        <p class="abstract">This topic describes how to publish a hosted application from <MadCap:variable name="BrandingMS.Microsoft Visual Studio 2010" /> for debugging purposes, using the publishing feature included in <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" />.</p>
        <p>The publishing feature included with <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.Amalga SDK" /> allows you to use test configuration and instance information included in the application manifest and service manifests of a hosted application to quickly publish a hosted application from within <MadCap:variable name="BrandingMS.Visual Studio 2010 second use" /> to a target Amalga topology for debugging purposes.</p>
        <p>Before you can use the publishing feature, however, you must ensure that the appropriate elements and attributes are added to the application manifest and service manifests, and then set to the values appropriate to your target Amalga topology and debugging requirements. </p>
        <p class="caution">You must also successfully build the hosted application in <MadCap:variable name="BrandingMS.Visual Studio second use" /> before you can publish it, to ensure that the appropriate files are present prior to publication. The publishing feature will rebuild all of the projects required for the hosted application in <MadCap:variable name="BrandingMS.Visual Studio second use" /> during the publishing process.</p>
