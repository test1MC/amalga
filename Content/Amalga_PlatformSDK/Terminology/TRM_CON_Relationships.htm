            <MadCap:keyword term="relationships:Terminology platform application;Terminology platform application:relationships;concepts:Terminology platform application;Terminology platform application:concepts;Terminology platform application:relationship types;relationship types:Terminology platform application" />This topic describes relationships, which represents associations between two concepts in the Terminology platform application.</p>
        <p>In a single terminology, concepts can be related to each other in a variety of ways. For example, the following diagram illustrates a typical acyclic hierarchical relationship structure between clinical concepts in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) clinical terminology. </p>
        <p>For more information about the ICD-9 clinical terminology, see <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.htm">International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)</a>, on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention site<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Production.PrintOnly"> at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.htm</MadCap:conditionalText>.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Figure">While concepts are important to a terminology, the relationships between concepts provide the real power and flexibility to allow a clinical terminology to consistently and accurately describe a vast range of clinical concepts. Typically, relationships either describe a hierarchical relationship between concepts, as shown in the previous diagram, or describe attributes related to a given concept.</p>
        <p>Each relationship contains the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Source concept</p>
                <p>The source concept typically represents the starting or parent endpoint of a relationship, depending on the relationship type.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Relationship type</p>
                <p>The relationship type describes the characteristics of the relationship itself. For more information about relationship types, see <MadCap:xref href="TRM_CON_RelationshipTypes.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Relationship types on page 1</MadCap:xref>. Relationship types are specific to a given terminology.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Target concept</p>
                <p>The target concept typically represents the ending or child endpoint of a relationship, depending on the relationship type.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Terminology</p>
                <p>This property indicates the terminology that contains the relationship. If a relationship is contained by a clinical terminology, it typically describes a relationship between two concepts contained by that clinical terminology. If a relationship is contained by a mapping terminology, it typically describes a relationship between two concepts contained in two different clinical terminologies. For more information about clinical and mapping terminologies, see <MadCap:xref href="TRM_CON_Terminologies.htm" target="" title="" alt="">Terminologies on page 1</MadCap:xref>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Supported language</p>
                <p>Similar to concepts, relationships support multiple languages. One or more relationships, each in a different language, can describe the same relationship between two concepts.</p>
                <p class="caution"><MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV3 first use" /> does not support relationships in multiple languages at this time.</p>
