            <MadCap:keyword term="Terminology platform application:relationship types;relationship types:Terminology platform application" />This topic describes relationship types, which describe the relationships between concepts in the Terminology platform application.</p>
        <p>In the Terminology platform application included with <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" />, relationships between concepts are described by a relationship type. The relationship type describes the characteristics of the relationship, such as whether the relationship is hierarchical, and provides a display name which can be used when graphing relationships between concepts.</p>
        <p>Relationship types are specific to a given terminology. For example, the relationship types included with the SNOMED&#160;CT clinical terminology provide defining and qualifying characteristics, which allow concepts to be used as attributes for other concepts, or historical relationships, which allow concepts to be versioned or inactivated. </p>
        <h2>Relationship type attributes</h2>
        <p>Relationship type attributes define the characteristics of the relationship type. Multiple relationship type attributes can apply to a single relationship type. For example, the Resolved By relationship type, included with the HLI&#160;Core terminology, describes an immutable, reciprocal, ordered, displayable relationship.</p>
        <p>The following relationship type attributes can be applied to a single relationship type:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2012-02-26T16:48:25.8911961-08:00" MadCap:creator="v-labenn" MadCap:initials="LLB" MadCap:comment="make a 2-col. table? attribute/description" MadCap:editor="v-labenn" MadCap:editDate="2012-02-26T16:48:59.4527608-08:00">Acyclic</MadCap:annotation>
                </p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that the relationship type describes an acyclic relationship, such as a tree relationship, between two concepts. Otherwise, the relationship type can describe a cyclic relationship.</p>
                <p>For example, the "Next Version" relationship type, included with the "HLI&#160;Core" terminology, describes a typical acyclic relationship.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Displayable</p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that this relationship type can be displayed. Otherwise, the relationship type should not be displayed.</p>
                <p>For example, all relationship types included with the "HLI&#160;Core" terminology are displayable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Hierarchical</p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that the relationship type describes a hierarchical relationship between two concepts. Otherwise, the relationship type describes a non-hierarchical relationship. </p>
                <p>For example, the "Subsumes" relationship type, included with the "HLI Core" terminology, describes a typical hierarchical relationship.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Immutable</p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that the relationship type describes a relationship that, once referenced, cannot be changed. Otherwise, the relationship can be changed.</p>
                <p>For example, the "Dependency" relationship type, included with the "HLI&#160;Core" terminology, describes a typical immutable relationship.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>InheritanceRelation</p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that the relationship type describes an inheritance relationship.</p>
                <p>For example, the "RXNORM&#160;Constitutes" relationship type, included with the "HLI&#160;RXNORM" terminology, describes a typical inheritance relationship.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Ordered</p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that the relationship type describes an ordered relationship.</p>
                <p>For example, the "Resolved By" relationship type, included with the "HLI&#160;Core" terminology, describes a typical ordered relationship.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Reciprocal</p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that the relationship type describes a reciprocal relationship.</p>
                <p>For example, the "Validated By" relationship type, included with the "HLI&#160;Core" terminology, describes a typical reciprocal relationship.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Transitive</p>
                <p>If set to True, this relationship type attribute indicates that the relationship type describes a transitive relationship between concepts. If concept A has a transitive relationship with concept B, and concept B has a transitive relationship with concept C, then concept A has an implied transitive relationship with concept C. </p>
                <p>For example, the "Subsumes" relationship type, included with the "HLI Core" terminology, describes a typical transitive relationship.</p>
