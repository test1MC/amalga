        <p class="abstract">This topic summarizes the <MadCap:variable name="FeatureName.materialized entity view" /> feature.</p>
        <h2>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Materialized entity view" />Materialization overview</h2>
        <p>When you bind an <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV3 first use" /> entity, the system automatically materializes the associated entity view to improve query performance of the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" /> applications that use the virtual schema based on the entity. Entity binding detects all binding changes when you save them.</p>
        <p> For first-time binding or when there is a change in the binding, the system calls the <MadCap:variable name="Applications.Materialized Entity Manager (application)" /> application, which provisions a set of database artifacts and registers the entity with its underlying data source to be tracked.  The service then periodically monitors the underlying tables used by the entity for any changes and synchronizes the changes to the materialized entity table.</p>
        <p class="note">Every time you change an entity's binding, a new set of materialization artifacts is created and populated.  When you have a large set of data, the initial population (seeding) of the entity can take a while. </p>
        <p>During the seeding period, the entity fetches data directly from the underlying data source and you can expect the following behavior:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The query performance for the virtual schemas using the entity might be slower.</li>
            <li>Any eventing solution that is set on the application view is stopped. Eventing automatically resumes when the new materialized entity complete the seeding. However,  there can be duplicates of missing events during the transition.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before you can bind an entity to an <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV2" /> <![CDATA[ ]]><MadCap:annotation MadCap:createDate="2012-03-09T12:42:38.9350750-08:00" MadCap:creator="v-ccole" MadCap:initials="V-" MadCap:comment="Disussed using V2 w/ Cindy.

For help preparing an <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.AmalgaV2" /> data source, contact <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Resources/Snippets/phrase-your-Microsoft-representative.flsnp" />. </p>
        <p>The following functions and clauses are not supported in a view used for entity binding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-deterministic function (for example, using the GETDATE function to calculate patient's age).</li>
            <li>Use of TOP clause to return only the first set of rows from the query results.</li>
            <li>Use of CROSS JOIN, INTERSECT and EXCEPT clauses in a query.</li>
            <li>Use of GROUP BY clause in a query.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the previous clauses or functions are found, the <MadCap:variable name="Applications.Materialized Entity Manager (application)" /> application throws an error at the time of binding. You must remove the unsupported clause before you can try to bind the entity again.</p>

        <h2>Error handling during materialization</h2>
        <p>Errors can occur during the seeding or updating phases materialization. The <MadCap:variable name="Applications.Materializer (application)" /> service also attempts to switch the entity to fetch data directly from the underlying (unmaterialized) data source to ensure data availability. The following table shows the errors that can be sent to the Doors event log.</p>

                            <li>Attempting to switch from a materialized entity due to an error. Because the switch fails, the entity continues to read from the materialized entity even though  the <MadCap:variable name="Applications.Materializer (application)" /> service stops updating the materialized entity until the issue is resolved.</li>

        <p>The materialization backlog is calculated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Number of batches of update on the underlying data source * number of entities using the changed table.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if the PID segment is updated in two update batches and there are five entities bound to the PID segment, then the backlog is 10. After the <MadCap:variable name="Applications.Materializer (application)" /> service updates two entities, the backlog is reduced to eight.</p>
