        <p>All of these indentations can be accomplished without using styles that force an indent. </p>
        <p>Reasons to indent:&#160;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Align unnumbered/unbulleted paragraph between list items</li>
            <li>Align lists under a glossary definition or other outside-list, already-indented paragraph </li>
            <li>Multiple single item lists without bullets or numbers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Non-list Paragraphs between List Items</h2>
        <p>In this example, unnumbered/unbulleted paragraphs are aligned within a list. This alignment requires making sure that the paragraphs are within the OL&#160;or UL&#160;tag for the list. No other special tagging is required to achieve the indentation in the output. Remember to check the preview window to see how the content will line up. </p>

            <li>This is a standard list item. </li>
            <li>
                <p>This is in a p block because it has a following non-list paragraph. You get a structure like this by typing in this line, right-clicking on the &lt;li&gt; block and selecting <b>Make paragraph item(s)</b>. Then you go to the end of this text, and press ENTER to get the next paragraph, which will be without a number.</p>
                <p>This paragraph is also in a "p" (no class) block and it will line up under the text in step 2. You would do a note, tip, etc. the same way. Click the preview button to see what it looks like.</p>
                <p>To make the next numbered item, press ENTER, then click on the yellow and black arrow icon.</p>

        <p>In this example, hierarchy relative to an already-indented paragraph (p.GlossaryDefinition) is indicated by further indentation, achieved by two layers of unordered lists (two nested UL&#160;tags). </p>
