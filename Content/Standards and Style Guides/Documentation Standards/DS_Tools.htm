        <h2>MadCap Flare</h2>
        <p>All content created for publication by the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Microsoft Amalga" />  User Assistance (UA) teams is developed using MadCap Flare (currently version 7.1) specified by UA management. UA management evaluates each version of Flare when it is released and advises the writers when it is appropriate to install the update.</p>
        <p>All content in user guides and IT Pro documentation is created manually by creating Flare topics, images, snippets, and other resources as needed. </p>
        <p class="tip">With the exception of the licenses purchased for the team when Flare was first installed, the "v-" writer's employer supplies MadCap software.</p>
        <h2>Visual Studio 2010</h2>
        <p>All documentation source files are stored in an instance of Visual Studio Team Foundation Server that is integrated with MadCap Flare. An instance of Visual Studio 2010 is required on authors’ computers to connect to the Team Foundation Server.</p>
