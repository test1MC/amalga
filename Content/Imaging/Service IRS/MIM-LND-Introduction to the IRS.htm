        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Imaging Registry and Document Service Application" />The <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.Imaging Registry and Document server" /> application (IRDA) exposes the following two APIs for consumption by <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" /> controls and applications, including the <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.Study browser web part" />:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Study, series, instance-level metadata</li>
            <li>The name of the corresponding <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.Image Delivery server" /> application instance for a given site ID</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Typically, a provider works with  multiple healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and other service delivery points, which may be geographically remote from each other. <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short"></MadCap:variable> collects the medical data from different sites and systems by ingesting and storing the text-based HL-7 feeds at a central location. While the bandwidth between geographically -remote sites may be sufficient to enable a centralized approach for HL-7 messages, it does not meet the scalability demands of <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM"></MadCap:variable> data sets, each of which can involve transferring gigabytes of data. Furthermore, the concurrent accesses to centralized <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM"></MadCap:variable> data from different sites would have a negative impact on performance.</p>
        <p>To overcome these issues, <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Medical Imaging Module" /> supports a distributed topology: <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM" /> feeds are received and stored locally, while the metadata extracted from <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM" /> headers is stored at a central location, similar to HL-7 feeds.</p>
