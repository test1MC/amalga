        <p class="abstract">This topic explains the topology for the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Medical Imaging Module" />.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Imaging:topology overview" />Typically, a care provider organization has multiple health facilities including hospitals, clinics, and other service delivery points, which may be geographically remote from each other. <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Amalga Short" /> aggregates medical data from different sites and systems by ingesting the HL-7 feeds and storing the text-based data at a central location. Although the network bandwidth between health facilities is often sufficient to enable a centralized approach for HL-7 messages, it may be far from meeting the performance and scalability demands for <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM" /> feeds, each of which can involve transferring gigabytes of data every day.</p>
        <p>To overcome this problem, the <MadCap:variable name="BrandingHSG.Medical Imaging Module" /> supports both centralized and distributed deployment topologies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="Label">Centralized topology</span>
                <p>Ingestion of <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM" /> feeds happen at a central location, which is typically a data center. In addition to single-facility organizations, care providers with multiple facilities can choose this option provided that <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM" /> feeds are sent from each remote location to the central location.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="Label">Distributed topology</span>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:variable name="Imaging.DICOM" /> feeds are ingested locally at multiple facilities. While the incoming images are stored only locally, part of the ingested metadata is sent from each remote facility to the central site.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
